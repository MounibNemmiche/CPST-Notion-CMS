# Notion-CMS-CPST Website

## About 

It uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion using there [API](https://developers.notion.com/) and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

The site is deployed to [Netlify](http://netlify.com).

This repo is what I use to power CPST Website, click [HERE](https://cpst.netlify.app) to check it out.

Writing posts is as simple as creating a page in my beloved [Notion](https://notion.so/) ❤
