# Notion-CMS-CPST Website

## About 

This repository powers the [CPST Website](https://cpst.netlify.app/) It uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion using there [API](https://developers.notion.com/) and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

The site is deployed to [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
